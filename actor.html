                <p>Felicity Rose Hadley Jones is an English actress. Jones was born in Birmingham, West Midlands, and grew up
                    in Bournville. Her parents met while working at the Wolverhampton Express and Star. Her father was a
                    journalist while her mother was in advertising. They divorced when she was three, and she was brought
                    up with her brother by her mother alone. She has said that her family is still "extremely close." Her
                    uncle is actor Michael Hadley.
                </p>

                <p>She started her professional acting career as a child, appearing at age 12 in The Treasure Seekers (1998).
                    She went on to play Ethel Hallow for one series in the television show The Worst Witch and its sequel
                    Weirdsister College. After Kings Norton Girls School, Jones attended King Edward VI Handsworth School,
                    to complete A Levels and went on to take a gap year (during which she appeared in the BBC series Servants

                    since she graduated with a 2:1 from Wadham College, Oxford in 2006, where she read English. While studying
                    English, she appeared in student plays, including Attis in which she played the title role, and, in 2005,
                    Shakespeare's "Comedy of Errors" for the OUDS summer tour to Japan, starring alongside Harry Lloyd.</p>

                <p>
                    On radio, she is known for playing the long-running role of Emma Grundy in The Archers. In 2008, she appeared in the Donmar
                    Warehouse production of The Chalk Garden. Since 2006, Jones has appeared in numerous films, including
                    Northanger Abbey (2007), Brideshead Revisited (2008), Chéri (2009), and The Tempest (2010). She stars

                    prize at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. In 2014, her performance as Jane Hawking in The Theory of Everything
                    (2014) was also met with critical acclaim, garnering her nominations for the Golden Globe, SAG, BAFTA,

                    best friend and fellow actor Gael Garcia Bernal played the title role. After 'El Abuelo y Yo', Diego

                    cast in the critically acclaimed Y Tu Mamá También (2001), once again alongside his best friend Gael
                    Garcia Bernal, as Tenoch Iturbide..</p>

                    Dirty Dancing 2', the prequel to 'Dirty Dancing' and is working on more projects in both Latin America

                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>Alan Tudyk was born in El Paso, Texas, and grew up in Plano, where he attended Plano Sr. High. In 1990, he
                    went on to study drama at Lon Morris Jr. College. While there, he was awarded the Academic Excellence
                    Award for Drama. He was also named Most Likely to Succeed and Sophomore Beau. During this time, Alan
                    was also an active member of the Delta Psi Omega fraternity.
                </p>

                <p>After leaving LMJC, Alan went on to study at the prestigious Juilliard conservatory but left in 1996 before
                    earning a degree. After a number of smaller stage productions and a small role in the movie Patch Adams
                    (1998), Alan landed his first Broadway role in 1999 with "Epic Proportions." He quickly became a sought-after
                    comedic actor, with roles in such films as 28 Days (2000) and A Knight's Tale (2001).</p>

                <p>
                    In 2002, Alan got the role of Wash, the wise-cracking pilot of Serenity on the short-lived series Firefly (2002). Although
                    it lasted only eleven episodes, this may be Alan's most well-known and best-loved role. No other networks
                    would buy the failed series, but Universal Pictures began courting creator Joss Whedon to produce a big-screen
                    version of the series. While awaiting the final news of Firefly's fate, Alan played the beloved Steve
                    the Pirate in the movie Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004) and the voice of the robot Sonny in I,
                    Robot (2004).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2005, Alan finally reprised the role of Wash in Serenity (2005), the feature-film version of the series Firefly. The same
                    year, he went back to Broadway from June to November, taking over the role of Lancelot for Hank Azaria
                    in the successful musical "Spamalot." He lives in New York City but also has a place in Los Angeles,
                    California
                </p>
